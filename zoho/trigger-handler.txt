Copy the below piece of sample code in the Trigger Handler: 

response = Map();
response.put("action", "reply");
response.put("replies", {
    {
        "text": "Hey! Welcome to my store! Ahh..well I own it when my human friends aren't around. So tell me, what brings you here?"
    }
});
options = {
    "Great deals of the day",
    "Need any help with purchasing?",
    "Have a query?",
    "Just browsing"
};
response.put("suggestions", options);
return response;
